Description: VISOVA(VISualization Of VAriance) is a novel method for exploratory data analysis. It is basically an extension of the trellis graphics and developing their grid concept with parallel coordinates, permitting visualization of many dimensions at once. This package includes functions allowing users to perform VISOVA analysis and compare different column/variable ordering methods for making the high-dimensional structures easier to perceive even when the data is complicated.
